/*
761. Special Binary String

*/


/*

Just 4 steps:

Split S into several special strings (as many as possible).
Special string starts with 1 and ends with 0. Recursion on the middle part.
Sort all special strings in lexicographically largest order.
Join and output all strings.
Updated:

The middle part of a special string may not be another special string. But in my recursion it is.
For example, 1M0 is a splitted special string. M is its middle part and it must be another special string.

Because:

The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's in M
If there is a prefix P of Mwhich has one less 1's than 0's, 1P will make up a special string. 
1P will be found as special string before 1M0 in my solution.
It means that every prefix of M has at least as many 1's as 0's.

            if(count == 0){
                sub.push_back("1"+makeLargestSpecial(S.substr(beg+1,i-beg-1))+"0");
