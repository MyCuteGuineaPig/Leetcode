237. Delete Node in a Linked List


4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9
Example 1:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
Example 2:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
