51. N-Queens

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an nÃ—n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.



Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

For example,
There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:

"""

"""
In this problem, whenever a location (x, y) is occupied, any other locations (p, q ) 
where p + q == x + y or p - q == x - y would be invalid. 
We can use this information to keep track of the indicators (xy_dif and xy_sum ) of the invalid positions
 and then call DFS recursively with valid positions only. 


At the end, we convert the result (a list of lists; each sublist is the indices of the queens) into the desire format.
