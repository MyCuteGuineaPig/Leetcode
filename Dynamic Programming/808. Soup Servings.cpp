/*
Example:
Input: N = 50
Output: 0.625
Explanation: 
   A, B 一开始都是50 ml,
   1. serve A 100 ml, serve B 0  ml,  probability = 1 * 0.25
   2. serve A 75 ml,  serve B 25 ml,  probability = 1 * 0.25
   3. serve A 50 ml,  serve B 50 ml,  probability = 0.5 * 0.25 
   4. serve A 25 ml,  serve B 75 ml,  probability = 0 * 0.25 

 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.

/*
It's obvious that A is easier to be empty than B. And when N gets bigger, we have less chance to run out of B first.
So as N increases, our result increases and it gets closer to 100 percent = 1.

Answers within 10^-5 of the true value will be accepted as correct.
Now it's obvious that when N is big enough, result is close enough to 1 and we just need to return 1.
When I incresed the value of N, I find that:
When N = 4800, the result = 0.999994994426
When N = 4801, the result = 0.999995382315
So if N>= 4800, just return 1 and it will be enough.

如果不大于25 的话, 直接return 0.5 , 比如 N = 3, 3/25 = 0,
